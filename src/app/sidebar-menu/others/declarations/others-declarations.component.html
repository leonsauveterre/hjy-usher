  <h1>✨ Declarations ✨</h1>
  <p>As we blaze our trails through development, we stand on the shoulders of giants. Here are some of the incredible open-source projects that make this journey possible!</p>

  <ul class="declaration-list">
    <li>
      <strong>🌐 Angular:</strong> The core framework powering this site. Angular brings the structure, components, and smooth two-way data binding magic that makes all of this possible!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>🌈 Prism.js:</strong> For the beautifully highlighted code snippets that bring technical guides to life. Syntax coloring for every curious mind!
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>🌑 Darkmode-js:</strong> Because we respect your eyes! This nifty tool allows you to switch to the dark side (without joining any evil empires).
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>⏰ datetime:</strong> Every second counts! Thanks to datetime libraries, we handle dates and times like a pro, from creating timestamps to keeping logs and entries perfectly synced.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>📜 Many Others:</strong> From styling helpers to utility packages, the open-source community fuels our work. A shout-out to everyone who makes these resources available, sharing their work so the rest of us can keep building!
    </li>
  </ul>
